                <h4>Vernissage for my paintings</h4> <br>
                <p>An exhibitor contacted me and wanted to have a vernissage with my paintings at The Nut House. These were never meant to be seen by the public, and were created only for my own walls, but I couldn't say no.<br><br> 
                    They are painted in acrylic paint on canvases between 30x40 cm to 120x100 cm. This is a selection these. <br>
                    <br> I sold a majority of them and have plans with the same exhibitor to make another round but with official art.
